### IMAGE-ALIGNED
This project demonstrates two crucial computer vision techniques: **Template Matching** and **Feature-Based Image Alignment (using ORB and Homography)**. Both aim to find correspondences between images but work in different ways and are suitable for different scenarios.


### Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is twofold:

1.  **To illustrate and contrast two fundamental computer vision techniques for finding correspondences between images:**
    * **Template Matching:** Demonstrating its utility for locating exact, relatively rigid patterns or objects within a larger image, particularly when the target's appearance remains consistent.
    * **Feature-Based Image Alignment (using ORB and Homography):** Showcasing a more robust approach for aligning images of the same scene or object that may have undergone transformations such as rotation, scaling, translation, or perspective changes. This highlights the power of local feature descriptors in handling more complex real-world variations.

2.  **To provide a practical understanding of key concepts in image processing and computer vision:**
    * **Grayscale Conversion:** Its importance for certain algorithms.
    * **Correlation and Similarity Metrics:** How `cv2.matchTemplate` quantifies the match quality.
    * **Keypoint Detection and Description (ORB):** Understanding how unique points and their local characteristics are identified.
    * **Feature Matching:** The process of finding corresponding features between two images.
    * **Homography Estimation (RANSAC):** How a geometric transformation matrix can be robustly computed from noisy feature matches to enable image warping and alignment.

Ultimately, this project serves as an educational tool to grasp the principles behind locating objects within images and bringing disparate image views into geometric registration, forming a basis for applications like object recognition, image stitching, augmented reality, and quality control.

### Project Explanation (Detailed)

The code can be broken down into two main parts:

#### Part 1: Template Matching

**Purpose:** To find occurrences of a small "template" image within a larger "base" image. It's often used for locating specific objects or patterns where the object's appearance doesn't change much (e.g., finding an icon on a screen).

**Steps:**

1.  **Import Libraries:**
    * `cv2`: OpenCV for image processing.
    * `numpy`: For numerical operations.
    * `matplotlib.pyplot`: For displaying images.
    * `google.colab.files`: For uploading files in Google Colab.

2.  **Upload Images:**
    * `uploaded = files.upload()`: Allows the user to upload two images.
    * `img_path = file_names[0]`: The first uploaded image is considered the `base image`.
    * `template_path = file_names[1]`: The second uploaded image is the `template image`.

3.  **Read and Display Images:**
    * `img = cv2.imread(img_path)`: Reads the base image.
    * `img_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)`: Converts the base image from BGR (OpenCV default) to RGB for correct display with Matplotlib.
    * `template = cv2.imread(template_path, 0)`: Reads the template image directly in grayscale (`0` flag). Template matching usually works best on grayscale images.
    * `w, h = template.shape[::-1]`: Gets the width and height of the template.
    * `plt.imshow(img_rgb)` and `plt.imshow(template, cmap='gray')`: Displays both the base and template images.

4.  **Convert Base Image to Grayscale:**
    * `img_gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)`: Converts the base image to grayscale. This is important because `cv2.matchTemplate` generally operates on single-channel (grayscale) images for efficiency and effectiveness.

5.  **Apply Template Matching:**
    * `res = cv2.matchTemplate(img_gray, template, cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED)`: This is the core function.
        * `img_gray`: The source image where the template is to be searched.
        * `template`: The template image.
        * `cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED`: This is one of several comparison methods. `TM_CCOEFF_NORMED` computes the normalized cross-correlation, resulting in values between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a perfect match and 0 indicates no match. Other methods exist for different scenarios.
    * The `res` matrix (result map) contains correlation coefficients for each possible position of the template in the base image.

6.  **Find Best Match Location:**
    * `min_val, max_val, min_loc, max_loc = cv2.minMaxLoc(res)`: Finds the minimum and maximum correlation values, and their respective locations (x, y coordinates) in the `res` map. For `TM_CCOEFF_NORMED`, `max_val` and `max_loc` correspond to the best match.
    * `top_left = max_loc`: The top-left corner of the detected region.
    * `bottom_right = (top_left[0] + w, top_left[1] + h)`: Calculates the bottom-right corner using the template's width and height.

7.  **Draw Bounding Box:**
    * `cv2.rectangle(img_rgb, top_left, bottom_right, (255, 0, 0), 3)`: Draws a red rectangle around the detected template location on the *original RGB* image.
        * `(255, 0, 0)`: Red color (RGB).
        * `3`: Thickness of the rectangle line.

8.  **Display Result:**
    * `plt.imshow(img_rgb)`: Shows the base image with the bounding box indicating the matched region.

**Note:** The template matching code block is duplicated in the provided snippet. It performs the same operation twice.

#### Part 2: Feature-Based Image Alignment (ORB and Homography)

**Purpose:** To align two images that capture the same scene but from different viewpoints, scales, rotations, or with slight perspective distortions. This is more robust than template matching when the object or scene undergoes transformations.

**Steps:**

1.  **Upload Second Image for Alignment:**
    * `uploaded2 = files.upload()`: Prompts for another image to be used for alignment. This will be `img_align`.
    * `alignment_img_path = list(uploaded2.keys())[0]`: Gets the path of the uploaded image.
    * `img_align = cv2.imread(alignment_img_path)`: Reads the alignment image.
    * `img_align_gray = cv2.cvtColor(img_align, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)`: Converts it to grayscale.
    * `img_gray_base = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)`: Converts the *original base image* (from Part 1) to grayscale again, as it will be one of the images to align.

2.  **Keypoint Detection and Description (ORB):**
    * `orb = cv2.ORB_create(5000)`: Initializes the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) detector. ORB is a robust and computationally efficient algorithm for detecting keypoints (distinctive features) and computing their descriptors (numerical representations of the keypoints' local appearance). `5000` is the maximum number of features to retain.
    * `kp1, des1 = orb.detectAndCompute(img_gray_base, None)`: Detects keypoints (`kp1`) and computes their descriptors (`des1`) for the base image.
    * `kp2, des2 = orb.detectAndCompute(img_align_gray, None)`: Does the same for the alignment image.
    * **Demonstration of Keypoints:** The code snippet `img = cv.imread('WhatsApp Image 2025-06-27 at 14.57.39_4aa28bf9.jpg', cv.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)` and the subsequent ORB detection and drawing (`img2 = cv.drawKeypoints...`) appear to be a standalone demonstration of ORB keypoint detection on a *pre-defined image file*, not directly connected to the uploaded images in the flow. It shows what keypoints look like.

3.  **Feature Matching (Brute-Force Matcher):**
    * `bf = cv2.BFMatcher(cv2.NORM_HAMMING, crossCheck=True)`: Initializes a Brute-Force Matcher.
        * `cv2.NORM_HAMMING`: Specifies the distance metric for comparing descriptors. Hamming distance is suitable for binary descriptors like ORB.
        * `crossCheck=True`: Ensures that a match (A to B) is only considered if the best match for A in B is B, and the best match for B in A is A. This makes the matching more robust.
    * `matches = bf.match(des1, des2)`: Finds the best matches between descriptors from the base image and the alignment image.
    * `matches = sorted(matches, key=lambda x: x.distance)`: Sorts the matches by their distance. Shorter distances indicate better matches.

4.  **Draw Matches:**
    * `img_matches = cv2.drawMatches(img, kp1, img_align, kp2, matches[:50], None, flags=2)`: Draws the first 50 (best) matches between the two images. Lines connect corresponding keypoints. `flags=2` draws only the keypoints and their matches.

5.  **Estimate Homography:**
    * `src_pts = np.float32([kp1[m.queryIdx].pt for m in matches[:50]]).reshape(-1, 1, 2)`: Extracts the coordinates of the keypoints from the *base image* that were part of the good matches.
    * `dst_pts = np.float32([kp2[m.trainIdx].pt for m in matches[:50]]).reshape(-1, 1, 2)`: Extracts the coordinates of the keypoints from the *alignment image* that were part of the good matches.
    * `M, mask = cv2.findHomography(dst_pts, src_pts, cv2.RANSAC, 5.0)`: Calculates the homography matrix (`M`).
        * Homography is a $3 \times 3$ matrix that describes the transformation (rotation, translation, scale, perspective) between two planes.
        * `dst_pts, src_pts`: The corresponding points from the two images. Note the order: `findHomography` calculates the transformation from `dst_pts` to `src_pts`.
        * `cv2.RANSAC`: RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) is a robust algorithm used to estimate parameters of a mathematical model from a set of observed data containing outliers. It's crucial here to discard incorrect matches (outliers) and find the best transformation.
        * `5.0`: Represents the maximum allowed reprojection error (in pixels) for a point to be considered an inlier.

6.  **Warp (Align) Image:**
    * `aligned_img = cv2.warpPerspective(img_align, M, (width, height))`: Applies the calculated homography matrix `M` to the `img_align` to warp it and align it with the `img_rgb` (the base image). The output image dimensions are based on `img_align`.

7.  **Display Aligned Image:**
    * `plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(aligned_img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))`: Displays the `img_align` after it has been transformed and aligned.

### Project Explanation (Brief)

This project showcases two core computer vision techniques for image correspondence:

1.  **Template Matching:** Finds exact occurrences of a small **template image** within a larger **base image**. It's useful for locating specific, unchanging patterns and highlights the best match with a bounding box.

2.  **Feature-Based Image Alignment (ORB & Homography):** A more robust method for aligning two images of the same scene that may have different perspectives, scales, or rotations. It involves:
    * **Detecting distinctive features (keypoints)** in both images using the ORB algorithm.
    * **Matching these features** between the two images.
    * **Calculating a Homography matrix** (a transformation matrix) from the best matches using RANSAC to handle outliers.
    * **Warping one image** using the homography to align it with the other.

In essence, the project moves from simple pattern detection to complex image registration, demonstrating how computers can "see" and relate visual information across different views.


### Conclusion of the Project

In conclusion, this project effectively demonstrates the distinct applications and capabilities of **Template Matching** and **Feature-Based Image Alignment**.

We successfully used **Template Matching** to accurately pinpoint a specific pattern within a larger base image, proving its efficiency for direct pattern detection in controlled environments.

Furthermore, we showcased the more advanced technique of **Feature-Based Image Alignment**. By leveraging the **ORB descriptor** for robust keypoint detection and matching, and subsequently computing a **homography matrix with RANSAC**, we achieved successful geometric alignment between two images of the same scene despite variations in viewpoint and perspective. This highlights the critical role of robust feature extraction and transformation estimation in handling real-world image distortions.

The project reinforces the understanding that choosing the appropriate technique (template matching for rigid patterns vs. feature-based alignment for deformable or transformed objects/scenes) is crucial for effective computer vision solutions. It provides a solid foundation for understanding how computers can 'see' and relate visual information, enabling a wide array of applications in automated inspection, augmented reality, and image reconstruction.
